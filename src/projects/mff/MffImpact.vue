    This project wasn’t just about building a product—it was a masterclass in
    problem-solving. Gamification proved to be more than just a buzzword; it
    became a powerful tool for learning, showing us that people, especially
    those in the 20-35 age range, grasp financial skills more easily when
    progress feels rewarding and bite-sized. Collaboration across UX, business,
    and marketing reinforced another key lesson: the best products emerge when
    diverse minds work in sync. And then there was the pressure—the relentless
    ticking clock that forced us to strip away the unnecessary. While it may
    have limited some creative freedom, it brought sharp clarity to what truly
    mattered, helping us deliver something meaningful in record time.
